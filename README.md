# Technologies used for the Englebert's lessons

The technologies were not covered in depth. Just the essential notions to get started quickly. Resources are added to go further.

Documentation can be generated with mkdocs. Use the following resources to install and configure mkdocs in virtual environment:
- [Official docs of virtual env in python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- [Official docs of mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- [Mkdocs Material reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/)
- [Mkdocs github projets](https://github.com/mkdocs/)
- [Official site Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- [Github markdown](https://docs.github.com/fr/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
